# Introduction to Python Course
 
This course is based on the book below and the corresponding Jupyter notebooks of *Jake VanderPlas*. The course in its original format can be found [on Github](https://github.com/jakevdp/WhirlwindTourOfPython). As reading from and writing to a file is belonging also to the basics, Kinga Sipos created the complementray Chapter *14-File Input and Output*. Chapter *18-Plotting* was also added to provide a first experience with plotting in Python. Some other little details were created and/or changed. Finally extra exercises were added in order to enhance the interactivity of the course.

*A Whirlwind Tour of Python* is a fast-paced introduction to essential
components of the Python language for researchers and developers.

According to *Jake VanderPlas* the material is particularly aimed at those 
who wish to use Python for data 
science and/or scientific programming, and in this capacity serves as an
introduction to his next book, *The Python Data Science Handbook*.
These notebooks are adapted from lectures and workshops *Jake VanderPlas* has given on these
topics at University of Washington and at various conferences, meetings, and
workshops around the world.
